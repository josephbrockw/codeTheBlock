    <h2 class="title">Vision</h2>
      <p>Code the Block envisions a nation that provides a sustainable pipeline of access and opportunity to tech careers for those in underserved communities.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Mission</h3>
    <p>Code the Block accelerates the growth of Kansas City's tech and startup community through comprehensive educational programs. </br></br>

      We intend to do this through:
      <div class="mission">
        <ul>
          <li> Increasing access, exposure, and participation in Computer Science - particularly in the urban core </li>
          <li> Taking students from zero knowledge in a specialized computing skill to employment </li>
          <li> Developing diverse tech talent in Kansas City that lacks the workforce fill the market </li>
          <li> Advocating for comprehensive computer science education for every child in Kansas City</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </p>
    <h3 class="title">Our Solution</h3>
      <p>Code the Block's educational programs aim to create a clear path to success that minimizes the chances that a student becomes overwhelmed, frustrated and quits. We bring together the brightest minds from the education and tech circles to provide students with a quality learning experience in a supportive environment. This will allow us to take students all the way to employment and insure time spent working produces the best results. We seek to provide an empowering educational experience, increasing student engagement and success.
      </br></br>We will leverage this success to form future employment partnerships with tech companies, working towards filling the tech demand gap. In addition to this, we will leverage our success to form partnerships with schools, districts, and community organizations to replicate similar educational programs across the city, multiplying the impact and reach to every student in every community.
      </br></br>As more people gain meaningful tech education and training, we can generate the talent needed to fill the demand gap of tech jobs in Kansas City, stimulating the local economy.</p>
